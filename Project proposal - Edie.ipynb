Then create a new variable Social_time_met using CONNECTION_preference_time_friends_grouped and CONNECTION_social_time_friends_p7d_grouped, as both of them have the same categories, we can rank their choices and calculate; if actual time ≥ preferred time, code it as “Met” (1).\n",
    "If actual time < preferred time, code it as “Not Met” (0). Set the alpha value to 0.05. Use python to construct out spearman correlation, and calculate out the p-value.
